#  Disabled checks:
#
#  altera-*
#    Not applicable.
#
#  bugprone-easily-swappable-parameters
#    Not always easy or sensible to avoid.
#
#  cppcoreguidelines-avoid-c-arrays
#  hicpp-avoid-c-arrays
#  modernize-avoid-c-arrays
#    Using std::array instead isn't always that great either.
#
#  cppcoreguidelines-pro-bounds-array-to-pointer-decay
#  hicpp-no-array-decay
#    Limited use and many false positives including for all asserts.
#
#  cppcoreguidelines-pro-bounds-pointer-arithmetic
#    This is a low-level library, it needs to do pointer arithmetic.
#
#  cppcoreguidelines-pro-type-vararg
#  hicpp-vararg
#    The libc has some of these functions.
#
#  cppcoreguidelines-avoid-magic-numbers
#  readability-magic-numbers
#    Too strict.
#
#  fuchsia-*
#    Much too strict.
#
#  google-runtime-references
#    This is just a matter of preference, and we can't change the interfaces
#    now anyways.
#
#  llvm-header-guard
#    Using #pragma once
#
#  llvmlibc-*
#    Not applicable.
#
#  modernize-use-trailing-return-type
#    We are not that modern.
#
#  readability-identifier-length
#    Some variables can have shorter names, that's okay.
#
#  readability-implicit-bool-conversion
#    I don't think this makes the code more readable.
